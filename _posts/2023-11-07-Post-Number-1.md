<div dir="ltr">
I used <a href="https://www.bing.com/create">BingCreate</a> to create my image which is an AI by "Microsoft Bing" that needs a description to create an image totally by it self.
<br>
Here is my journey...
<br>
Actually it was really easy to use this. Simply you type a description of picture you are imagining and AI creates it. What I had in my mind was a man who stands in top of a mountain and sees a view infront of him and there are two mountains faraway in the view. So I wrote:
<br>
"There are two mountains at each side of the image and there is a man at the center who sees them faraway, and it is a bit foggy."
<br>
What I got was 4 nice pictures. The best ones were first two:
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
<style>
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>

<div class="gallery">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series1-1.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series1-2.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series1-3.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series1-4.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
</div>
{% endraw %}
<br>
It was close to what I wanted but I needed some feeling in it so I wrote:
<br>
"There are two mountains at each side of the image and there is a man at the center who sees them faraway, and it is a bit foggy, it has a mysterious and deep theme like the man thinks about his future, world, etc."
One of the things I found out is that if you wanna add something to your picture, you have to continue what you have written already at description box.
<br>
I got :
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
<style>
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>

<div class="gallery">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series2-1.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series2-2.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series2-3.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series2-4.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
</div>
{% endraw %}
<br>
Problem was I didn't want any moons or planets at the sky, so I said Delete Moons!
Here is what my description looked so far:
<br>
"There are two mountains at each side of the image and there is a man at the center who sees them faraway, and it is a bit foggy, it has a mysterious and deep theme like the man thinks about his future, world, etc. Delete moons."
Here is what I got:
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
<style>
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>

<div class="gallery">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series3-1.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series3-2.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series3-3.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series3-4.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
</div>
{% endraw %}
<br>
What I learned here was that this AI can't understand negative! Try this: "A picture without moons and a with a beautiful jungle.",
 you are gonna get a moon. It analysis the words not the meaning. Though pictures were actually nice.
<br>
I tried another way of saying I don't want moons and also I wanted a little bit of darkness.
<br>
"There are two mountains at each side of the image and there is a man at the center who sees them faraway, and it is a bit foggy, it has a mysterious and deep theme like the man thinks about his future, world, etc. But there is no moons and theme light is a bit dark"
<br>
Results were:
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
<style>
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>

<div class="gallery">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series4-1.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series4-2.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series4-3.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series4-4.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
</div>
{% endraw %}
<br>
I though the images were not realistic and tried another thing to delete moons(thought maybe they are planets).
<br>
"There are two mountains at each side of the image and there is a man at the center who sees them faraway, and it is a bit foggy, it has a mysterious and deep theme like the man thinks about his future, world, etc. But there aren't any moons or planets and theme light is a bit dark. Make a bit more realistic"
<br>
Hmm...nice aren't they?
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
<style>
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>

<div class="gallery">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series5-1.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series5-2.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series5-3.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series5-4.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
</div>
{% endraw %}
<br>
It is ironic but I was like: "Let's add some cyberpunk."
So I wrote:
"There are two mountains at each side of the image and there is a man at the center who sees them faraway, and it is a bit foggy, it has a mysterious and deep theme like the man thinks about his future, world, etc. But there aren't any moons or planets and theme light is a bit dark. Make a bit more realistic but it is a bit cyberpunk"
<br>
And here happened magic:
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
<style>
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>

<div class="gallery">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series6-1.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series6-2.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series6-3.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
    <img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series6-4.jpg" alt="Image not found.">
</div>
{% endraw %}
<br>
And this was really good. I even was like: "Wait minute, planets or moons are really good actually."
In my opinion the best one was this one:
<br>
<br>
<img src="/assets/images/ImagesPost5/Series6-2.jpg">
<br>
I think this really says what I wanted to say. Watching some hills thinking about future of humans and yourself. Image one was really good too.
<br>
Overall I had a good time and got some beatiful images.
